    // Define some attributes 
        //Number - a number stored inside the file and doesn't define the different types of numbers (integers, short, long etc)
        //String - pretty much just text (including spaces)
        //Boolean - wants to know true or false (definites)
        //Array - a special *variable* that holds data in a specific structure 0,1,2,3 list 
        //Dictionary/Object - a special *variable* which also holds data in a specfic structure, we define the first part of the list 
        //undefined - a variable that has not been assigned a value or not declared 

    // If/Else loops - a conditional statement for arriving to a desired outcome 
    
    //functions - parameters = simply the names listed in the function definition in the brackets -- 
    //argument - the specific value we are passing as the parameter 

    //arrays 
        //add to the front -- use unshift method 
        //add to the back -- use push method 
        //

    //loops
        // for loop - loops through a block of code 
        //for in - loops through properties of ab object 
        // while -- loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true 
        //do while - loops through a block of code once - then repeats when a specified condition is true 
        //forEach -- uses a anonymous (automatic) function for every single element for an array 
    //object - dictionary 
        //delcare object - use notation {}
        //lookup key to retive value -- example 
            // var person = {name:john}
            // person.name  will then return john
